# Modular MoPSS Main Controller Unit

This is the code for the main controller unit which controls the high level behavior of all Modular MoPSS modules.

The function is currently to provide a gating system for mice to allow exactly one mouse to pass through.

This is a work in progress and functionality is in the progress of being fine-tuned and experimentally validated for final release (Due 2023).

The Modular Mouse Position System is an open source behavioral experimentation platform for mice.
